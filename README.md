# RushHour
A python implementation of the game rush hour with four solving algorithms.

- Random search algorithm
- Breadfirst search algorithm
- a short_cut algorithm (improvement of random), that tries to cut an algorithm shorter
- a random_bfs algorithm, which is a mix between random and best first search

## running the game
inside the RushHour folder, you can run:

$ python main.py

In main.py You can also specify which algorithm you want to run, just by uncommenting this section.

## installation
there are serveral installations required before you can run this app:

sys, time, random, numpy, copy, os, matplotlib, csv
